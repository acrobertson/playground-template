I occasionally need to play around with some HTML/CSS/Javascript stuff in a way that doesn't work on http://codepen.io.

This is a simple template that I can use as a base for these kinds of experimental projects.

### Features
* Fast build/watch with Webpack 4
* ES6/ES17 support via Babel
* Styles using SASS
* jQuery 3.1

### Commands

* `npm run build` - Perform a basic webpack build of all files
* `npm run watch` - Watch JS/SCSS files for changes
* `npm run clean` - Remove compiled files
* `npm run dev` - Start a webpack-dev-server on http://localhost:8080 (or http://localhost:8081) with hot-reloading
