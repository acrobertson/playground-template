I occasionally need to play around with some HTML/CSS/Javascript stuff in a way that doesn't work on http://codepen.io.

This is a simple template that I can as a base for these kinds of experimental projects.

### Features
* Fast build/watch with webpack
* ES6/ES17 support via Babel
* SCSS compilate
* Bootstrap 3 styles
* jQuery 3.1
